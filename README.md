## Overview

This is the official Ontology TypeScript SDK - a comprehensive library for developing with the [Ontology blockchain](https://ont.io) in both TypeScript and JavaScript. It currently supports management of wallets, digital identities and digital assets - as well as the deployment and invocation of smart contracts.

## Getting Started

* 进入 [中文版](https://ontio.github.io/documentation/ontology_ts_sdk_zh.html).
* Enter [English Version](https://ontio.github.io/documentation/ontology_ts_sdk_en.html).

## Installation

### Download Through npm/Yarn

````
npm install 'ontology-ts-sdk' --save
````

or

```
yarn add 'ontology-ts-sdk'
```

### Build from Source Code

#### Downloading

```
git clone 'https://github.com/ontio/ontology-ts-sdk.git'
```

Then install the dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

or

```
yarn
```

#### Compiling

Compile the project with the:

````
npm run build:dev // or npm run build:prod
````

or

```
yarn run build:dev // or yarn run build:prod
```

This will create a compiled version of the SDK in the `lib` directory.

#### Testing

To run the tests in the `test` directory, use:

```
npm run test
```

or

```
yarn run test
```

### Use in Project

#### Import

Using `import` to include the modules from `'ontology-ts-sdk'`:

```
import {Wallet} from 'ontology-ts-sdk';
var wallet = Wallet.create('test');
```

#### Require

Using `require` to include the modules from `'ontology-ts-sdk'`:

````
var Ont = require('ontology-ts-sdk');
var wallet = Ont.Wallet.create('test');
````

#### In the Browser

To use in the browser you must use the compiled version (as listed above).
The `browser.js` file is located in the `lib` directory.
Include it into the project with a `<script>` tag:

````
<script src="./lib/browser.js"></script>
````

Everything will be available under the `Ont` variable, just like in the `require` example above.

```
var wallet = Ont.Wallet.create('test');
```
